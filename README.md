# Number-Guesser-Python
A number guesser using a stochastic gradient descent neural network to guess handwritten numbers. The neural network was coding using only numpy and pandas (to read CSV). It was trained on the MNIST-handwritten numbers dataset available at http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. This is a simple network consisting of an input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer. The network is also using ReLU for its activation function. After training, the network saves the arrays of the respective weights and biases of each layer in a text file. These weights and biases are then read into the "NumberGuesser" program to guess the hand written number. The number guesser is made using pygame and PIL to allow the user to "handwrite" their number. When the user clicks the "Analyze" button, the drawn image is fed through the network using the previously saved weights and biases, displaying the guess of the number.
